# 🌊 AI Water Footprint

AI models require substantial computational resources — and surprisingly, **a single prompt can use as much water as a glass or more** due to the cooling needs of data centers. This extension aims to raise awareness and empower more sustainable use of these technologies.

**AI Water Footprint** is a lightweight browser extension that tracks how many prompts you submit to popular AI services (like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude) and estimates the **water usage** associated with your activity — helping you reflect on the often-hidden environmental costs of AI.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Tracks queries submitted to:**
- [x] ChatGPT
- [x] Google Gemini
- [x] Claude

✅ **Displays:**
- [x] Daily query count  
- [ ] Cumulative query count  
- [x] Estimated water consumption
  - [ ] *(based on up-to-date academic references)*  
- [x] Contextual comparisons to real-world water use (e.g., "equivalent to a short shower 🚿")
- [x] Dynamic badge on extension icon showing today's usage

## 📊 Data & Estimates

Water consumption per AI query will based on publicly available data and peer-reviewed sources.

> 🔍 **To be updated** using recent estimates from  
> [🌐 arXiv:2505.09598](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09598)  
> (and other peer-reviewed resources).
