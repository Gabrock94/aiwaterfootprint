# 🌊 AI Water Footprint

**AI Water Footprint** is a lightweight browser extension that tracks how many prompts you submit to popular AI services (like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude) and estimates the **water usage** associated with your activity — helping you reflect on the often-hidden environmental costs of AI.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Tracks queries submitted to:**
- ChatGPT (`chat.openai.com`, `chatgpt.com`)
- Google Gemini (`gemini.google.com`)
- Claude (Anthropic)

✅ **Displays:**
- Daily query count  
- Cumulative query count  
- Estimated water consumption *(based on up-to-date academic references)*  
- Contextual comparisons to real-world water use (e.g., "equivalent to a short shower 🚿")

✅ **Other highlights:**
- Dynamic badge on extension icon showing today's usage
- Runs entirely locally (no cloud tracking or analytics)
- Data stored safely in your browser’s local storage

## 📊 Data & Estimates

Water consumption per AI query is based on publicly available data and peer-reviewed sources.

> 🔍 **To be updated** using recent estimates from  
> [🌐 arXiv:2505.09598](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09598)  
> (and other peer-reviewed resources).

## 🛠️ Coming Soon
- [ ] Improved water estimate calibration based on GPU/model type  
- [ ] Support for additional AI platforms (e.g., Perplexity, Copilot)  
- [ ] Export and visualize usage trends over time

## 📦 Installation

*Coming soon to Chrome Web Store and Firefox Add-ons.*  
For now, load as an unpacked extension via your browser’s developer tools.

## 💡 Why?

AI models require substantial computational resources — and surprisingly, **a single prompt can use as much water as a glass or more** due to the cooling needs of data centers. This extension aims to raise awareness and empower more sustainable use of these technologies.
